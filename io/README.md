# io

Basic C and C++ input/output. Reading and writing text streams, using stdin, stdout, stderr, and user-specified files. These commands also utilize command-line arguments (`argc` and `argv`).

* **`read.c`** and **`read.cpp`** work exactly the same way, as do **`write.c`** and **`write.cpp`**.
* **`head.c`** and **`echo.c`** are replicants of the GNU/Linux commands **head** and **echo**, respectively
